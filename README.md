This application uses the mtcars dataset in the R datasets library.

The data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973-74 models).
A data frame with 32 observations on 11 variables.  
[, 1]	 mpg	 Miles/(US) gallon  
[, 2]	 cyl	 Number of cylinders  
[, 3]	 disp	 Displacement (cu.in.)  
[, 4]	 hp	 Gross horsepower  
[, 5]	 drat	 Rear axle ratio  
[, 6]	 wt	 Weight (lb/1000)  
[, 7]	 qsec	 1/4 mile time  
[, 8]	 vs	 V/S  
[, 9]	 am	 Transmission (0 = automatic, 1 = manual)  
[,10]	 gear	 Number of forward gears  
[,11]	 carb	 Number of carburetors  

You can can select specific ranges for several of the variables using the control panel located on the left side.
The result for the selected data is shown in the main panel on the right side.
The mean for weight and MPG is calculated for the selected data and a plot is also shown for this data.
A table shows the data for all the observations that meet the selection you chose.
